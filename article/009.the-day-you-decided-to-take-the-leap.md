## Sentences 

`Life leaps come in varying distances.`

Some feel `lofty` and `risky`.

Some are difficult `yet manageable`.

Every life path is open, and `the world is their oyster`.

`As a human being grows into adulthood`, however, things shift. `Whereas` an `infant` goes through the world with curiosity, an adult is expected to move about with `justification`. Life choices must be made with analysis, and interestingly, even `inaction` requires this type of reasoning as well.

>一种理解：小时候人们用好奇心去探索世界，长大后却都需要一个“理由”，做什么需要理由，不做也需要理由。
>
>另一种理解：小时候是好奇心驱动去探索世界，长大了却开始分析“得失”。

After all, the `justified` mind is one that understands `loss aversion` – one that wouldn’t want to `trade` the comfort and safety of the present moment `for` an uncertain and `rocky` future.

> 「loss aversion」：白捡的 100 元所带来的快乐，难以抵消丢失 100 元所带来的痛苦。当我们做有关收益和有关损失的决策时表现出的不对称性。

Why call my sister to `patch things up` when it’s easier to just ignore her?

> 这里的 call 不是叫某人，而是打电话给某人。

it’s the most `sensical` thing to do once you frame it in the proper light.

While you can easily predict the concerns of making any leap, there is no way to predict the numerous rewards that `await you` on the other side.

`Forgoing` stability for the unknown `is not limited to` the lens of salaries and occupations. It `applies to` any situation where `a gap exists between who you think you are today, and who you know you want to become`.

While career leaps are `glorified` in today’s world, the reality is that most leaps are about something deeper. Ultimately, the most important jumps have little to do with our jobs, and more to do with our growth as a human being. And sure, doing `fulfilling` work contributes to that cause, but it’s just one of many parts of our `identities` that require a move into a higher `realm`.

`To illustrate, let’s take the example of` two siblings: Bob, and his sister Agnes.

The future is nowhere near as predictable as we’d like it to be.

This asymmetry is everywhere. `It exists in the person` who was scared to publish personal essays in fear of `ridicule`, but decided to take the leap and do it anyway. `It exists in the person` who was nervous to go on a dedicated `workout regimen` in fear of failure, but decided to take the leap and do it anyway. 

Taking the leap is not some `irrational` act that is driven by the passions. When you understand the `asymmetrical nature` of `manageable concerns` vs. `unimaginable benefits`, taking the leap is no longer an emotional jump, but a logical next step toward the life you want to lead.
