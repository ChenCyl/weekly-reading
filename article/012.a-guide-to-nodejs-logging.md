## Summary

本文介绍了一些和 Node.js 日志相关的知识。

什么时候需要打日志？

- Quick debugging of unexpected behavior during development
- Browser-based logging for analytics or diagnostics
- Logs for your server application to log incoming requests, as well as any failures that might have happened
- Optional debug logs for your library to assist the user with issues
- Output of your CLI to print progress, confirmation messages or errors

一条日志可能包含哪些信息？

- Timestamp - to know when things happened
- Computer/Server Name - in case you are running a distributed system
- Process ID - in case you are running multiple Node processes using something like [`pm2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2)
- Message - an actual message with some content
- Stack Trace - in case we are logging an error
- Maybe some additional variables/info

从优秀的开源项目中也可以学到打日志的方法、规范和常用的工具。

## Sentences 

While `>` allows us to redirect the output of a command into a file, `2>` allows us to redirect the output of `stderr` into a file.

`pino` follows a philosophy that for the sake of performance, you should move any processing of the logs into a separate process by piping (using `|`) the output. 

 If we consult the [`express` documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/debugging.html) you'll notice that you can prepend a `DEBUG=express:*` to your command like so: `DEBUG=express:* node index.js` .

You can check if`stdin`, `stdout` or `stderr` are in terminal mode by checking the [`isTTY`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_a_note_on_process_i_o) attribute on the respective stream. For example: `process.stdout.isTTY`. `TTY` stands for "teletypewriter" and in this case specifically for Terminal.

when you develop a CLI you should always be aware of situations where your CLI might run in CI mode or where the output is redirected. (?why)
