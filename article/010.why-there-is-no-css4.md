## Summary

CSS 的规范经历了两个阶段：

1. CSS1 Specs 和 CSS2 Specs 都是非常庞大的 Specs，它们包含了 CSS 中的一切
2. 由于 CSS 快速发展，很难去划分一个范围，CSS2.1 之后，之前庞大的规范被分解为了许多模块，每个模块有自己独立的规范，规范的升级按照 Level 1、2... 的命名方式

所以，从 CSS2.1 之后，就再无 CSS3、CSS4，只有 CSS Selectors Level 3 或 CSS Selectors Level 4。

Current work of CSS is [here](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work).

## Vocabulary

|            | 解释        | example                                    |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| monolithic | adj. 庞大的 | CSS version 1 and 2 were monolithic specs  |
| massive    | adj. 巨大的 | All of CSS was included in one massive doc |

## Sentences 

As CSS has grown in complexity, and new features are added, it doesn’t make sense to draw a line at which all work is stopped on all parts of CSS in order to declare that CSS version *finished*. 

Therefore, after CSS2.1 all the things that had been part of the 2.1 specification were broken down into modules. 

As the new CSS modules included `all that had gone before` plus `any new features`, they all came into being at Level 3.
